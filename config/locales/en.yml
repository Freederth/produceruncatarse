      legend_html: "Having clear answers to these questions will help tremendously in structuring your campaign, <br>increasing the chances that it will be successful."
      title_one: "What inspired you to make this campaign?"
      tip_one: "People only engage when they realize the importance of a cause for society or for the person who leads a campaign. So be very clear about what is your inspiration and let it overflow into your campaign."
      title_two: "What is the focus?"
      tip_two: "Catarse is an excellent way to take the first steps. Therefore, define very well the purpose of your project, as well as who will benefit from it. Clearly defining your objectives is one of the best ways to engage people."
      title_three: "What is your goal?"
      tip_three: "Calculate all costs for the campaign execution and rewards delivery. Also take into account your ability to engage people in order to define your financial goal."
      title_four: "What is your deadline for the fundraising?"
      tip_four: "Don't underestimate the work of a campaign. You will have to work hard during the entire period the campaign is live, so, it's recommended that you don't tire yourself too much in this process. Our recommendation: 40 days of campaign."
      title_five: "Have you thought about the campaign rewards?"
      tip_five: "Remember that rewards are public promises. So, think very well when elaborating them, as well as the logistics in delivering them to your contributions. Our suggestion: think about immaterial rewards: downloads, experiences, courses e kisses."
      title_six: "Is your video ready?"
      tip_six: "The video is the business card of your campaign. It's through it that the contributions will get in touch with your cause. So, take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD is recommended."
      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
