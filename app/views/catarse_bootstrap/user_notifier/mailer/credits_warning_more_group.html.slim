| Hi #{ user.name } ,

br /
| In order to further simplify the process of repayments, 
'From 10/11 #{ link_to  ' no longer exist credits  That's why we came here to talk to you.
br /
br /
| So we check, you've got to use part of their claims, but still have #{ user.display_credits } here. This is money that can help make a difference in a project in which you believe. :-)
